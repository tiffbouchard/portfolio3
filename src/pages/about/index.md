I’m a developer, designer and creative. I love to see ideas come to life and am passionate about the intersection of art and technology. I have an unhealthy obsession with picking up new hobbies that I can’t maintain. 



I am currently working as a software developer in Toronto and working on a couple fun projects. Recently I’ve been filling my time with learning 3D, knitting and sewing, reading and learning Spanish.
