I am a developer, designer and all around maker of things. I love to see ideas come to life and create real things. I have an unhealthy obsession with picking up new hobbies and love to eat. 

Intersection of art and technology

My philosophy around virtual experiences is that they should be unique but not overwhelming. Clean but not boring. Focusing on content rather than fluff. 

I am currently working as a full-time software developer in Toronto and working on a couple side projects. I’m currently filling my time learning blender/3D, knitting, sewing and learning Spanish.

I love the digital world.

I read a ton, watch movies and run.
